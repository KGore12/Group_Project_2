__NOTE__ This repository has not yet been deployed. 

The data we are using comes from Politico via [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/etsc9287/2020-general-election-polls). In these current times, our team chose to focus on if there was a relationship between two major occurrences in 2020: an unprecedented presidential election and a worldwide pandemic. We were able to find a comprehensive dataset from Politico on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/etsc9287/2020-general-election-polls). Some of the major datapoints obtained were votes, demographic data, and Covid-19 numbers. We set out on a path to use data analytics to further visualize this data on these pages. Even though there is no definitive relationship, we can definitely see some trends with the data. 

Notes About the Data: Due to changes in data collection and reporting for both the 2020 presidential election and COVID-19, this is only a "snapshot" of the data sources up to November 1st, 2020 for COVID-19 data and November 10th, 2020 for the election data.
